web application 
- front end / ui --> html/css/js/react --> front end developer
- back end -> brain of web app --> node js --> backend developer
- Database layer --> sql/nosql --> mongo db

full stack developer --> front end + back end + database layer

MERN Stack -->
M - Mongo db
E - express.js
R - react
N - Node js

MEAN stack -->
M - Mongo db
E - express.js
A - Angular
N - Node js

MEAN and MERN stacks are popular technology stacks for web application development.
The main difference is that MEAN uses Angular as its front-end framework, 
while MERN uses React Js for its UI.
MEAN is more popular for enterprise-level architecture, while MERN is more popular for smaller applications.
