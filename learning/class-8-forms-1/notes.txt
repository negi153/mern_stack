forms -> a type of datastructure to collect user input data

Tags - 
form -> to create html form
input -> checkboxes, text box, radio button, calender etc --> to take input from user
        * type = "radio" -> to create radio button
                -> if we want to select only 1 radio button among multiple, then "name" attribute of each radio button should be same.
        * type="checkbox" -> to crete checkbox
        * type="text" -> to create text box [default]
        * type ="date" -> to get calender
        * type = "submit" -> create a button, and it send all the data from "form" to server 
                    or we can also specify in "action" attribute of form tag
        * type="file" -> uploadfile by selecting
        * image-> we can create image button
        * password
        


        * to get the data from input tags, we can get with the help of "id"
        * if we need to give default value to text field, then use "value" attribute
            <input type="text" value="hello" >  
                above will create a text box with "default value as <hello>"
        * "value" attribute will show content on the text input and button input
        * "paceholder" attribute will show content which will go away as we start entering data

label -> to create labels, increase readability
        * always include "for" attribute for label tag and it should always contain id of input element

select -> to create drop down
option -> to create options inside drop down(list,combo box)
button -> create button
textArea -> create element to take input multi-line text 
fieldset -> is used to group many elements inside form. it kind of create multiple section inside form. it will also create a border outside the form.
if we only give fieldset and don't give the legend then it will only create border
legend -> is used to give heading/caption for a section which is grouped by "fieldset" inside form. it will give heading on top of fieldset border.

* select-option combo will crete a list box where we can only select 1 item.
if we want to select multiple item then we have to provide "multiple" in select element
